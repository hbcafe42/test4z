## Test4z Test Drive

Test4z challenges the notion that high-quality testing is inherently time-consuming by offering a solution that accelerates the development process.

In this overview, we'll explain the "what and how" of unit testing with Test4z. The brief hands-on exercise covers Test4z's:

* Code Coverage - learning what is and isn't tested
* Mocks - how to decouple your testing efforts from dependencies on a "live" environment
* Spies - how to validate code correctness, whether at the black or gray box level.

### Installation steps

Follow these steps to copy the exercise source files:
1. Clone the [workshopdemos/test4z](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z) repository.
2. In Visual Studio Code, open a new window on the `testdrive` folder (_File &gt; New Window_ followed by _File &gt; Open Folder..._)
3. If you have already installed Test4z, replace these files with your own local versions:

  - `test4z.project.config.json`
  - `test4z.user.config.json`
  - `.vscode/settings.json`
  
  If you have not installed Test4z before, delete the above files from the cloned repository folder and run the Test4z installation command `t4z init`. It will prompt you for the installation parameters (host name, user name, HLQ, etc.).
