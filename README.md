Test4z challenges the notion that high-quality testing is inherently time-consuming by offering a solution that accelerates the development process.
If you would like to learn more about unit testing with Test4z, this repository includes an exercise presented in three different lengths:

* [Test4z Tutorial](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z/tree/main/workshop#readme) - this exercise can be done as part of a workshop
or done on your own. It will take around 45 minutes to complete. If you're new to unit testing with Test4z, the [Test4z Primer](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z/blob/main/docs/Test4z-Primer.pdf) covers everything you'll need to know.
* [Test4z Test Drive](https://github.com/workshopdemos/test4z/tree/main/testdrive#readme) - this quick overview includes hands-on
steps to give you a better idea of working with Test4z. It will take less than 15 minutes to complete.
* [Test4z "code along"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hFXFf17kEI) - this 13 minute YouTube video is a step-by-step exercise
that you can follow along as you code. It will take around 30 minutes to complete the exercise steps in your Visual Studio Code environment.
