## Test4z Workshop - Tutorial and Exercise 

For many developers, testing is viewed as a necessary but time-consuming task. Why is that? It's because testing COBOL applications often involves numerous manual steps or setting up complex input data scenarios. Test4z challenges the notion that high-quality testing is inherently time-consuming by offering a solution that accelerates the development process.

For this exercise, you'll follow these top-level steps:

* Part 1: Write/verify unit test using the recording (mock API)
* Part 2: Add validation logic to the unit test (spy API)
* Part 3: Add pass/fail checks to the unit test (assert API)
* Part 4: Run final test (optionally make it fail).

Detailed step-by-steps instructions are available in the [Test4z Tutorial - Exercise](./Test4z-Workshop.pdf). If you would like a short introduction to Test4z, check out the [Test4z Tutorial - Primer](./Test4z-Primer.pdf).
